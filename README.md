# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Professional Portfolio

Welcome to my central cybersecurity repository — a curated collection of projects, notes, scripts, and experiments as I progress through my journey from SOC1 foundations to Offensive Security and Malware Analysis.

## 🧭 My Roadmap

> **SOC1 → Bug Bounties → Pentesting → Red Teaming → Malware Development/Analysis**

This repo serves as a living archive of practical work, not just theory. It's structured to reflect my evolving skill set, tools I’ve used, and techniques I’ve practiced along the way.

## 📂 Repository Contents

## 🔜 Next Skill Goals  
Immediate priorities as I shift from blue team fundamentals into offensive security practice:

- Web App Pentesting Techniques (XSS, SQLi, IDOR, SSRF, etc.)  
- Recon & Enumeration (active/passive bug bounty recon methods)  
- Bash & Python Scripting for Exploitation  
- Brute Force, Fuzzing & Auth Bypass Methods  
- Manual Testing Methodology (beyond automated scanners)  
- Vulnerability Reporting & Writeup Practice  
- Responsible Bug Hunting Ethics

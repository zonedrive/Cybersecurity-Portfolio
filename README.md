# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Professional Portfolio

Welcome to my central cybersecurity repository — a curated collection of projects, notes, scripts, and experiments as I progress through my journey from SOC1 foundations to Offensive Security and Malware Analysis.

## 🧭 My Roadmap

> **SOC1 → Bug Bounties → Pentesting → Red Teaming → Malware Development/Analysis**

This repo serves as a living archive of practical work, not just theory. It's structured to reflect my evolving skill set, tools I’ve used, and techniques I’ve practiced along the way.
